- 👋 Hi, I’m Veronica Porubsky (@vporubsky).
- 👀 I’m interested in applying graph theory and modeling with recurrent neural networks to calcium imaging data collected from brain circuits implicated in anxiety in order to understand how information is encoded for fear memories in healthy and anxious phenotypes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build recurrent neural networks to represent network activity of neurons in the dentate gyrus.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that will shape how we understand mood and anxiety disorders.
- 📫 Please reach out to me at verosky@uw.edu.
